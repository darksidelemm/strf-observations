# STRF Doppler Observations from VK5QI
This repository is where I will store historical doppler observations collected at my satellite tracking station in Adelaide, South Australia.

I use COSPAR ID 8650, with details:
```
8650 QI  -34.7207  138.6928     80    Mark Jessop
```

All data is collected using Cees Bassa's most excellent strf software, available here: https://github.com/cbassa/strf
