# STRF Doppler Observations from VK5QI
This repository is where I will store historical doppler observations collected at my satellite tracking station in Adelaide, South Australia.

I use COSPAR ID 8650, with details:
```
8650 QI  -34.7207  138.6928     80    Mark Jessop
```

I have begun cataloguing frequencies of sats in the 400-403 MHz commercial satellite band here: https://github.com/darksidelemm/strf-observations/wiki/Sat-Frequency-Catalogue

All data is collected using Cees Bassa's most excellent strf software, available here: https://github.com/cbassa/strf
